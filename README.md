# Text Editor - Windows Forms

## Discription 
This is my first UI app. Since first time working with C# and Windows Forms i decided to use https://github.com/hjohnson12/TextEditor.git repo as a reference.
I like disign and Font Color implementation of hjohnson12, because of that i copy that to my own project.

## Build with
C#, Windows Forms, Visual Studio 2022
